## Teaching Statistics, at a glance

### Ed Statistics

[Ed](https://edstem.org/) is the official course Q&A forum used by UC Berkeley courses. As a TA, I love responding to student questions over Ed. Here is a summary of my Ed stats:

| Course | Semester | Answers | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| DATA 101 | Fall 2024 | 202 (top answerer) | 506 (top commenter) |
| CS 88 | Spring 2024 | 338 (top answerer) | 570 (top commenter) |
| CS 88 | Fall 2023 | 215 (top answerer) | 497 (top commenter) |
| CS 88 | Spring 2023 | 98 (#4 answerer) | 121 (#4 commenter) |

### Course Evaluations

Every semester, students have the option to fill out a course evaluation form to give feedback on their TAs. Here are some statistics on the evaluations I have received. All scores are on a scale from 0 (worst) to 7 (best).

## CalTeach Program
Jan 2022 - Dec 2022 | Berkeley, CA & Hayward, CA

CalTeach is a program offered at UC Berkeley for undergraduate STEM majors interested in education. Specifically, CalTeach students can pursue a minor or teaching credential (concurrently with their Bachelor's degree). CalTeach courses teach pedagogical skills and offer students the opportunity to be placed in a local K-12 classroom to observe and practice teaching.

As a CalTeach student, I've learned:

- How students learn
- How to **write lesson plans and assessments**
- How to guide students toward solutions
- How to **analyze problems from a pedagogical perspective**
- How to **help students overcome barriers** they may face in their education

I also gained practical teaching experience through my **field placements**:

- For my EDSTEM 82 field placement, I provided **1-on-1 virtual tutoring** for a 4th grade student during the Spring 2022 semester
- For my EDUC 130 field placement, I assisted a **high school Precalculus** teacher in Hayward, CA during the Fall 2022 semester

## CS 61A Exam Advice
Oct 2022 | Berkeley, CA

Check out my [blog post](_posts/2022-10-06-cs-61a-exam-advice.md) with advice on how to approach [CS 61A](https://cs61a.org) exams!

## Academic Intern for CS 61A
Jan 2022 - May 2022 | Berkeley, CA

- Answered student questions during weekly **lab sections** for [CS 61A](https://cs61a.org): Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

## CS 61B: RTFM, Defensive Programming, and Debugging
Jan - May 2022 | Berkeley, CA

As part of a [CS 61B Data Structures](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp22/) study group, I realized there were many practical software engineering skills that CS 61B does not have time to teach its students, but would be extremely helpful to know. To fill in this gap, I created a slideshow presentation called [RTFM, Defensive Programming, & Debugging](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q60KIMCg9SdpUQNAg0uLCFDhV7MckeO95at7p5PkNLs/edit?usp=sharing), which I presented to my study group.

After finalizing the presentation, I realized that it would probably be helpful to all 61B students, so I posted it on Piazza (where it was **endorsed by an instructor**) and on the unofficial CS 61B Spring 2022 Discord server.

## FTC 9656 Omega Robotics: Learn Code
Aug 2018 ‚Äì Feb 2021 | San Jose, CA

When I became Co-Captain of my high school robotics team, I made it my personal mission to ensure that technical and non-technical skills were passed down to new members, since I did not receive any training when I first joined.

This effort culminated in a **website I created called [Learn Code](https://omega9656.github.io/learn-code/) which teaches introductory Java, bash, Git, and GitHub.** It is essentially an online textbook, but uses straightforward language to make CS more accessible. I also created Google Form quizzes, coding problems, and solutions for students to practice. The website was also shared with the larger FIRST Tech Challenge community on the corresponding Discord server, which had over 6,000 members when I shared it.
