I'm interested in all things computer science, education, and computer science education! Here's some of my work and experience in that area.

- Topics include Python, higher order functions, lists, dictionaries, recursion, trees, linked lists, object-oriented programming, exceptions, efficiency, iterators, generators, and SQL

## Coordinator for Computer Science Mentors (CSM)
Jan 2022 - Present | Berkeley, CA

CSM is a club on the UC Berkeley campus that organizes supplemental tutoring sections for lower division computer science and EECS courses. Currently, I'm serving as **CS 88 Coordinator** (Spring 2023 - Present), where I am:

- **Managing 30+ weekly tutoring sections**
- Hosting exam review sessions
- **Reviewing weekly teaching materials** (worksheets and slideshows)
- Interviewing prospective senior mentors

Previously, as a **CS 88 Senior Mentor** (Fall 2022) and **Junior Mentor** (Spring 2022), I:

- **Taught weekly tutoring sections**
  - Topics covered in CS 88 include Python, control, loops, higher order functions, lists, dictionaries, recursion, trees, linked lists, object-oriented programming, exceptions, efficiency, iterators, generators, and SQL
- Trained and **provided pedagogical feedback to Junior Mentors**
- Reviewed and **revised CSM content** (e.g. worksheets, slideshows, etc.)
- Created **walkthrough videos for past exam questions**

## CalTeach Program
Jan 2022 - Present | Berkeley, CA & Hayward, CA

CalTeach is a program offered at UC Berkeley for undergraduate STEM majors interested in education. Specifically, CalTeach students can pursue a minor or teaching credential (concurrently with their Bachelor's degree). CalTeach courses teach pedagogical skills and offer students the opportunity to be placed in a local K-12 classroom to observe and practice teaching.

As a CalTeach student, I've learned:

- How students learn
- How to **write lesson plans and assessments**
- How to guide students toward solutions
- How to **analyze problems from a pedagogical perspective**
- How to **help students overcome barriers** they may face in their education

I also gained practical teaching experience through my **field placements**:

- For my EDSTEM 82 field placement, I provided **1-on-1 virtual tutoring** for a 4th grade student during the Spring 2022 semester
- For my EDUC 130 field placement, I assisted a **high school Precalculus** teacher in Hayward, CA during the Fall 2022 semester

## CS 61A Exam Advice
Oct 2022 | Berkeley, CA

Check out my [blog post](_posts/2022-10-06-cs-61a-exam-advice.md) with advice on how to approach [CS 61A](https://cs61a.org) exams!

## Academic Intern for CS 61A
Jan 2022 - May 2022 | Berkeley, CA

- Answered student questions during weekly **lab sections** for [CS 61A](https://cs61a.org): Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
- Topics covered include Python, control, loops, higher order functions, lists, dictionaries, recursion, trees, linked lists, object-oriented programming, exceptions, efficiency, iterators, generators, SQL, Scheme, interpreters, regular expressions, and Backus-Naur Form

## CS 61B: RTFM, Defensive Programming, and Debugging
Jan - May 2022 | Berkeley, CA

As part of a [CS 61B Data Structures](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp22/) study group, I realized there were many practical software engineering skills that CS 61B does not have time to teach its students, but would be extremely helpful to know. To fill in this gap, I created a slideshow presentation called [RTFM, Defensive Programming, & Debugging](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q60KIMCg9SdpUQNAg0uLCFDhV7MckeO95at7p5PkNLs/edit?usp=sharing), which I presented to my study group.

After finalizing the presentation, I realized that it would probably be helpful to all 61B students, so I posted it on Piazza (where it was **endorsed by an instructor**) and on the unofficial CS 61B Spring 2022 Discord server.

## Code 4 Tomorrow (C4T)
Apr 2020 - Mar 2021 | Remote

- At C4T, I started out as a **curriculum developer for Python, Java, and Web Development** courses, which you can find [here](https://www.code4tomorrow.org/courses).
- Then I became a **Python instructor**. I taught both the **Beginner** and **Advanced** courses we offer.
- Finally, I became **Vice President** where I oversaw all of C4T's operations, including **130+ volunteers** and **180+ free** virtual coding **classes**, reaching **1100+ students**.

## FTC 9656 Omega Robotics: Learn Code
Aug 2018 ‚Äì Feb 2021 | San Jose, CA

When I became Co-Captain of my high school robotics team, I made it my personal mission to ensure that technical and non-technical skills were passed down to new members, since I did not receive any training when I first joined.

This effort culminated in a **website I created called [Learn Code](https://omega9656.github.io/learn-code/) which teaches introductory Java, bash, Git, and GitHub.** It is essentially an online textbook, but uses straightforward language to make CS more accessible. I also created Google Form quizzes, coding problems, and solutions for students to practice. The website was also shared with the larger FIRST Tech Challenge community on the corresponding Discord server, which had over 6,000 members when I shared it.
