<!-- TODO modify below -->

My first semester of college is over, so I thought I'd dump all of my survival tips and observations here
if anyone finds it helpful. It also doesn't hurt to think about everything I've learned. Who knows? Maybe
I'll rediscover this blog post in 10 years and it'll give me a good chuckle.

## ðŸš« Disclaimer

I'm *one* (EECS) student at UC Berkeley in Fall 2021 so take my advice with a grain of salt.

## 1. scheduling things back to back so you have longer periods of free time to work/play

## 2. bucket list items for a berkeley student

- visiting libraries
- campanile
- big c hike
- kayaking in the marina
- picnic on the glade
- museum of vertebrae zoology (IB 134L)

## 3. soda hall

- 7th floor, 6th floor seating

## 4. professors are just people

- go to oh/email/message them for research
- a lot of cool folks

## 5. research conference

(maybe make this a separate post)
teaching faculty w/o phd
networking lol
poster sessions
met a former student on same flight
met cmu student and we bonded over books

## 6. slack power user features, gmail snooze, google chrome profiles

## 7. maybe hopping around courses is the move for gaining teaching experience
