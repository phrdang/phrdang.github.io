title: Interning at Bloomberg
author: Rebecca Dang
---

This past summer, I had the privilege and pleasure to be a software engineer intern at [Bloomberg](https://bloomberg.com). Specifically, I was on the [Bloomberg Law](https://bloomberglaw.com) (BLAW) Platform Enablement team, working on integrating an authorization service, API gateway, and BLAW's Draft Analyzer API using Ruby on Rails. Due to NDA reasons, I can't really elaborate more on my project, but what I *can* talk about is my experience as an intern, Bloomberg's culture, and how my summer in New York City went!

## The intern experience

For some reason, my expectation going into my first internship was that I'd sit at my desk in the Bloomberg office and code for 8 hours a day. This could not be farther from reality as a Bloomberg intern (and I'm very grateful that it wasn't). Of course, I still had work to do in the form of my project, but there were intern events every week to keep things fresh and exciting. I loved that there was a variety of things to do, whether it was Tuesday Tech Talks, intern TED talks, boba-making, partying at the [Loeb Boathouse](https://www.thecentralparkboathouse.com/) (which sadly is [closing down](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/central-park-loeb-boathouse-closing/index.html)), sight-seeing at the [Edge](https://www.edgenyc.com/en), training sessions (for topics ranging from personal security to [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) to finance), team lunches, a Yankees baseball game, a broadway show (The Lion King), data center tours, tours of Bloomberg's Princeton office, and my favorite, the puzzle hunt. Suffice it to say, I was never bored during my internship and it was really fun.

## Bloomberg culture

## Summer in NYC

- moving in, 92y, and adjusting to nyc, cooking, independence
- going out with codebase friends, intern friends
- first 1.5 weeks - training and meeting new interns (college but free food and payment lol)
- pics, thank yous, people

*Side note, isn't it odd that I tend to publish my blog posts on the 16th of a month? I don't plan these things out at all, so it's very weird...*
