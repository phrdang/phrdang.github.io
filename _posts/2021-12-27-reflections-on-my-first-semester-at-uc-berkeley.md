## Introduction

This blog post is more of a place for me to dump all of my survival tips and observations.
Hopefully it's coherent enough for you to actually use it if you are a college student,
and specifically a *Berkeley* student.

## Disclaimer

I'm *one* (EECS) student at UC Berkeley so take my advice with a grain of salt.

## The Basics

### 1. Do everything you can to sleep at least 8 hours a day.

This will sometimes be a struggle depending on your schedule, but sleep is essential
so that you can remember what you learn and stuff you need to do. Also, it helps
to not feel terrible and groggy when you wake up.

### 2. Do everything you can to eat regularly and eat well.

I can't function if I don't eat breakfast so I always make sure to set aside time to do that.

### 3. Sleep 8 hours a day.

This is **crucial** and often overlooked. College is busy. It's probably the busiest
you'll ever be. But you have to draw the line somewhere -- it's better to sleep 7-8 hours
consistently even if that means not getting as much work done. You'll be much happier,
focused, and productive if you get a good night's sleep.

## Academics and Extracurriculars

### 4. Ask for help and figure out resources. Struggling together > struggling alone.

I feel like a lot of people, especially EECS/CS people, have this issue where
they were really awesome in high school and suddenly they're at a college where
*everyone* is smart and accomplished, and so no one really is. In high school, I didn't
really need to ask for much help so I didn't have much practice with showing
vulnerability. 

But college is **hard.** You need all the support you can get, so go to office hours.
Knock on your neighbor's door. Make study groups and **go to them consistently.**
I bet you'll find someone who's having the exact same problem you are, and when
you talk about it with them you'll both learn how to solve it.

### 5. Stop comparing yourself to others

> "Comparison is the thief of joy"

You're in college. There are people from all walks of life, who had varying resources and
opportunities because of it. More likely than not, you will find tons of people who
are "smarter" and "more accomplished" than you are and you'll just need to deal with it.
Instead of comparing yourself to others, I'd recommend focusing on doing *your* best.
You should really only be mad at yourself if you're not performing to your full potential,
not someone else's.

### 6. Talk to upperclassmen

In a similar vein with [#4](#4-ask-for-help-and-figure-out-resources-struggling-together--struggling-alone\),
talk to people who've gone through the college experience: upperclassmen! If you join general clubs
like [AWE (Association of Women in EE/CS)](https://awe.berkeley.edu) or [SWE (Society of Women Engineers)](https://swe.berkeley.edu) you will find many people with similar majors/interests who can provide advice.

I highly **recommend joining any club group chats/Slack Workspaces/Discord servers/subreddits/Facebook Groups**
as a way to talk to others too! I was (and still am) inundated with advice, opportunities, mentorship programs, jobs, etc. on those mass messaging platforms and it's super helpful to peruse the text channels when you have the chance. (Just make sure you
set your notification settings accordingly so you're not overwhelmed.)

### 7. (Try) to join clubs, but don't overload! (Depth > breadth)

Berkeley is [notorious](https://www.dailycal.org/2021/09/22/uc-berkeley-student-clubs-must-address-excessive-barriers-to-entry/) for its competitive club applications (at least, for STEM or business clubs. There are plenty of leisure clubs or performance clubs too; I'm not very familiar with their processes though). I wasn't really aware of this until I arrived on campus, and I think it helped me by making club applications a little less daunting.

Club applications were basically College Apps 2.0. The cool part is that you can really just recycle your college essays for many of the prompts that clubs give to you. Be prepared for multiple rounds of assessment as well -- in addition to the written application, I had multiple interviews (both technical and non-technical) and was lucky enough to land a spot in Berkeley [Codebase](https://codebase.berkeley.edu), a club that builds software for high-growth companies.

### 8. Start early

I've always felt that each successive year of my life has felt faster than the last, and my first semester at college has felt no different. It's very easy to fall behind and the best way to prevent that is to jump off the procrastination train before it runs you over. In other words, ***start everything early***.

College is not like high school where you have a 6-7 period day where everything is blocked out for you. You need to have the discipline and time management skills to do work when you have the time to do it. Otherwise you'll end up sleep deprived and kicking yourself for not starting earlier.

Going back to Must Do #7, many clubs start their recruiting process early, and I mean 1st or 2nd week of the semester early. Be on the lookout for tables at Sproul Plaza and Memorial Glade to get to know the club and learn about their different infosessions/events to see if you'd be interested in joining them. Additionally, you will need to balance doing club apps with your academics (midterm season never really ends once it starts), job(s) and/or job search, research, etc. if you have those.

### 9. You'll never feel 100% ready and that's okay. Go for it anyway.

### 10. Google Calendar is your scheduling friend. Notion is great for task management too!

## Social Life

### 11. Say yes to social life

If you grew up in a school environment like me, you might know the pressure to perform well academically, do every extracurricular, go to every recruiting event to get ahead. While it is important to grind, it is equally important to have fun. Especially in the first few weeks where everyone's finding friends, it's important to say yes to social outings to get to know your peers, loosen up, and rest your mind.

### 12. During orientation week, go on your own walks to orient yourself so you can navigate campus and the surrounding area.

Another tip: Once you know where your classes are, walk to them so you know how far away they are and where they're actually located! Nothing sucks more than being lost and late on your first day of class. You can also use social outings as an opportunity to explore the area and discover good food!

### 13. Find *your* people

[add]

## Dorm Life

### 14. Buy a long charging cable (10 meters at least) for your phone

Outlets are hard to come by in your dorm and you'll probably want to be able to grab your phone from your bed (which might be the top bunk, far away from the outlets near the floor)!

### 15. Communal bathrooms don't suck (mostly)


1.  communal bathrooms don't suck, helps to have a bag to hold everything though.


2.  berkeley is not cutthroat. like at all. everyone is just super talented/cool.
3.  gmail filters!
4.  notion!
5.  got due dates? write them down BEFORE the semester begins
6.  ipad/tablet is a good investment - portable, better for environment, convenient, easily share/access/submit notes/HW assignments
7.  stay connected to HS friends and family (if you are comfortable)
8.  dining hall food is meh but convenient for me bc unit 3
9.  get comfortable with being uncomfortable
10. go on hikes! take advantage of RSF!
11. restaurant recs
12. study groups, cs culture, club apps
