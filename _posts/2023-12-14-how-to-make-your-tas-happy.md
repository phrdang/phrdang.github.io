How to make your TAs happy
How to be a great TA

we're students too
learning names is hard but we're trying
grades, distributions, why we count exams, how scanning/grading works, what we have control over vs. not (e.g. waitlist stuff)

you have to be sensitive, empathetic, and not assume prior knowledge. example: difficulty of the course ed post. but also not condescending. difficult balance to strike.

Welcome to course staffing and +1 to everything said!
I think everyone preps a bit differently, but what I find is students will usually ask for help related to assignments in OH (very rarely have I encountered a purely conceptual question, unless it’s midterm/final season). So I like to make sure I’m familiar with the current assignment, like what the questions ask students to do. I try to do them myself if I have time or at least think about how a student would attempt it. Things to pay attention to are:
What concepts do students need understand to complete this problem?
What are some common approaches to solve this problem?
What are some common pitfalls for this problem?
What does the staff solution look like?
What are some hints I could give without giving away the entire solution?
One thing that can be very tempting when faced with a tricky question is to kind of tell them the step-by-step solution. While this is a fast way to resolve the problem, they might not get as much learning out of it. So what I try to do instead is ask them questions, like “what have you tried so far? what do you notice about the problem? what do you think caused the error message? what do we expect to happen at this part of the code? what if we printed out the value of <variable>? what if <this edge case scenario happened>, does the code currently handle this case?”
I also like pseudocoding with the student, and then once we complete the pseudocode, I leave it to them to implement. You can say something like, “Great, so we have a starting point to approach this problem. Why don’t you try implementing this in code yourself and if you run into issues feel free to requeue yourself”.
Giving a similar but simpler/smaller version of the problem can also be helpful for students to build intuition.
Another important thing to determine when helping a student in OH is what they’re actually trying to do / what question they’re really asking (the XY problem). Sometimes you can go down a rabbit hole only to realize what they asked for help doing is not even needed to solve the problem - so getting to the root of things from the start and asking clarifying questions is great. To do this in practice, I usually start by asking students if they can explain to me in their own words what the problem is asking them to do, what their current approach is, what issue they’re running into is, and how they have tried solving it.

saying idk >>>> making something up

OH is a lot like being a customer service rep
