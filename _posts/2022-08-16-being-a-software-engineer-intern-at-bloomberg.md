TODO write this post

- moving in, 92y, and adjusting to nyc, cooking, independence
- going out with codebase friends, intern friends
- first 1.5 weeks - training and meeting new interns (college but free food and payment lol)
- pics, thank yous, people

*Side note, isn't it odd that I tend to publish my blog posts on the 16th of a month? I don't plan these things out at all, so it's very weird...*
