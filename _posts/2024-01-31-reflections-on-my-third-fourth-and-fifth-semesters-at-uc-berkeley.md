title: "Reflections on my sophomore and junior years at UC Berkeley"
author: Rebecca Dang

It's been a while since I made a new blog post and even longer since my
[last reflection post](/2022/08/24/reflections-on-my-second-semester-at-uc-berkeley.html),
so this is long overdue. Let's jump in!

## ðŸš« Disclaimer

I'm _one_ (EECS) student at UC Berkeley so take my advice with a grain of salt.

## 1. College is long, but also short

When I'm in the thick of the semester, midterms are happening left and right, I have a dozen homework assignments
and projects due, college can feel really, really long. Like, "please get me out of here I just want to get
this over with and graduate and have a full time job already" long. I'm not sure if that's just the "academic rigor"
of Berkeley or just college in general, but sometimes that's just how I feel, and my perfectionist nature used
to mean that I would spend late nights to finish assignments instead of, say, hanging out with friends.

What I have learned since then is it helps to put things into perspective. College is only 4 years.
That's the same length of high school, and it feels even quicker in many ways. Do I want to spend those 4 years
moping about my workload or doing fun things with friends? Of course, you should do your work and do it well,
but at some point it's better to do what's required of you (and not necessarily more) and enjoy college
while you're still there. After you graduate, you'll probably be working for the next 40+ years of your life,
so why not enjoy the freedom you have left?

## 2. Relationships matter

Another major life lesson I have learned in the semesters since freshman year are that relationships are important.
I'm not talking about just romantic relationships, I mean all kinds of relationships: Romantic, platonic, teacher-student,
mentor-mentee, boss-employee, classmates, close friends, acquaintances, club members, etc.

This seems rather obvious but I think when I was little I had the mindset where as long as I focused on developing
myself and my skills, things would be fine. Developing yourself is great, but only half of the equation (and is
a rather lonely way to live).

Again, I think it's good to make sure you have a strong work ethic, but you should not focus solely on work
or your accomplishments because that alone will not make you happy, and they certainly won't help you
when you need advice or a helping hand. There have been many times this past semester where I really needed someone
to talk to, either to ask for help, get their opinion, rant, or just share a meme. Those are the moments
you will remember and cherish, not when you win a medal or get 100% on an exam. (There's also the practical
benefit of networking or finding roommates, but you should try to cultivate relationships for the sake of
getting to know people, not to get some advantage from it.)

## 3. Take a PE class

For a while I had no idea physical education (PE) classes existed at Berkeley, but [they do](https://pe.berkeley.edu/)!
I decided to take PE 1 Self-Defense: Yongmudo and PE 1 Basketball 1 and they were both a blast. I had never taken a martial arts
class before, and this was a nice introduction that got my blood pumping. And while I had played casual basketball with friends all the way back in 4th-5th grade, I had never had formal basketball training.

I highly recommend if you're like me and you need extrinsic motivation to work out and hate doing "boring" things like just running. I've always thought sports were fun (with a side benefit of keeping you healthy), so if you're into martial arts, archery, swimming, basketball, volleyball, dancing, boxing, yoga, etc., Berkeley PE has you covered. (Plus, you can
take them pass/no pass and they are usually only 0.5 units! This is perfect for Phase 1 where you weirdly
have a cap of enrolling in 12.5 units worth of classes.)

## 4. Join course staff

I joined [CS 88](https://c88c.org) course staff in the spring of my sophomore year as a tutor, became a TA, and just finished
my first semester as a head TA. It's really fulfilling and fun - you get to teach a subject you love, see how courses work behind the scenes, help the next generation of DS/CS/EECS majors, meet a lot of cool people, talk to the professor(s) of the course, and maybe even write exam questions! (Can you tell which ones I wrote?) You also get paid and prorated tuition remission, which is great! My only caveat is to make sure you have enough time in your schedule and to actually do the work because students (and the professor and head TAs) are counting on you.
