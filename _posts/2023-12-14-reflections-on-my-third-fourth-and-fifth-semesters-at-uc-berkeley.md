title: "Reflections on my third, fourth, and fifth semesters at UC Berkeley"

As I begin my 3rd year at UC Berkeley, it's time to reflect on the new things I learned from sophomore year. For my previous reflections post, click [here](/2022/08/24/reflections-on-my-second-semester-at-uc-berkeley.html).

## ðŸš« Disclaimer

I'm *one* (EECS) student at UC Berkeley so take my advice with a grain of salt.

## 1. College is long, but also short

When I'm in the thick of the semester, midterms are happening left and right, I have a dozen homework assignments
and projects due, college can feel really, really long. Like, "please get me out of here I just want to get
this over with" long. I'm not sure if that's just the "academic rigor" of Berkeley or just college in general,
but sometimes that's just how I feel, and my perfectionist nature used to mean that I would spend late nights
to finish assignments instead of, say, hanging out with friends.

What I have learned since then is it helps to put things into perspective. College is only 4 years.
That's the same length of high school, and it feels even quicker in many ways. Do I want to spend those 4 years
moping about my workload or doing fun things with friends? Of course, you should do your work and do it well,
but at some point it's better to cut your losses and enjoy college while you're still there. After you graduate,
you'll probably be working for the next 40+ years of your life, so why not enjoy the freedom you have left?

## 2. Relationships matter

Another major life lesson I have learned in the semesters since freshman year are that relationships are important.
I'm not talking about just romantic relationships, I mean all kinds of relationships: Romantic, platonic, teacher-student,
mentor-mentee, boss-employee, classmates, close friends, acquaintances, club members, etc.

Again, I think it's good to make sure you have a strong work ethic, but you should not focus solely on work
or your accomplishments because that alone will not make you happy, and they certainly won't help you
when you need advice or a helping hand. There have been many times this past semester where I really needed someone
to talk to, either to ask for help, get their opinion, rant, or just share a meme. Those are the moments
you will remember and cherish, not when you win a medal or get 100% on an exam. (There's also the practical
benefit of networking or finding roommates, but you should try to cultivate relationships for the sake of
getting to know people, not to get some advantage from it.)

## 3. Take a PE class

For a while I had no idea physical education (PE) classes existed at Berkeley, but [they do](https://pe.berkeley.edu/)!
I decided to take PE 1 Self-Defense: Yongmudo this semester and it was a blast. I had never taken a martial arts
class before, and this was a nice introduction that got my blood pumping. I highly recommend if you're like me
and you need extrinsic motivation to work out and hate doing "boring" things like just running. I've always
thought sports were fun (with a side benefit of keeping you healthy), so if you're into martial arts, archery,
swimming, basketball, volleyball, dancing, boxing, yoga, etc., Berkeley PE has you covered. (Plus, you can
take them pass/no pass and they are usually only 0.5 units! This is perfect for Phase 1 where you weirdly
have a cap of enrolling in 12.5 units worth of classes.)

## 4. Join course staff

I joined [CS 88](https://c88c.org) course staff in the spring of my sophomore year as a tutor and I just finished
my first semester as a TA. It's really fulfilling and fun - you get to teach a subject you love, help the next
generation of CS/EECS/DS majors, meet a lot of cool people, talk to the professor(s) of the course, and maybe
even write exam questions! (Can you tell which ones I wrote for the fall 2023 exams?) You also get paid and
prorated tuition remission, which is great! My only caveat is to make sure you have enough time in your schedule
and to actually do the work because students are counting on you.

## 5. Research
