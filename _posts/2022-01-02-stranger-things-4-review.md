***SPOILER WARNING: The following review contains spoilers for the entirety of Stranger Things 4, including Vol. 2 which was released this past Friday on July 1, 2022. Read at your own risk!***

## THIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING, SPOILERS AHEAD

## The Good

The **production value** of Stranger Things has never been better -- and good thing too, because [Netflix reportedly spent $30 million on average per episode](https://www.avclub.com/stranger-things-30-million-dollars-netflix-1848826585). The production design, costumes, VFX, cinematography, and use of licensed music was on point. Most of the cast (both new and returning) were also outstanding in their performances, so bravo to casting director Carmen Cuba for finding these talented actors. I bet it wasn't cheap to hire a starring cast of around 20 people! I'm also glad that Netflix had the confidence to allow the Duffer brothers to play around with the episode lengths (the last 2 episodes were about 1.5 and 2.5 hours, respectively), because it allowed the story to breathe a bit with the 4 different plotlines going on.

This season was also a **return to Stranger Things' horror roots** from S1 with Vecna's gruesome kills, lots of time spent in the slimy Upside Down, and a scene with the Demogorgon absolutely ripping apart the prisoners in the Russian prison. In comparison to the fun summer blockbuster vibe that S3 had, it really upped the stakes and there were several moments, especially in the 4th and 9th episodes, where I was truly unsure whether our favorite characters would make it out alive. The season finale was, without a doubt, the **most stressful finale** I have watched in my life so far, and the writers did a (mostly) good job of throwing up death flags for a lot of main characters.

I also enjoyed the writers' willingness to take some **narrative risks**, such as **the team's first major "loss" when Max "died,**" causing Hawkins to be split into quadrants and **unleashing the Upside Down into the real world**. It was a bit confusing for the characters to seemingly have no reaction to this besides the long stare into the distance in the final scene, I'm excited to see where the writers take us for the next and [final season](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/07/03/everything-we-know-about-stranger-things-season-5/?sh=5348b9603357).

Stranger Things 4 also succeeded in **giving many of the main characters a moment to shine**. Here were some of my favorites:

- Max "running up that hill," or rather out of Vecna's mind lair (episode 4), which served as a powerful metaphor for overcoming depression
- Max's confession about wanting Billy dead (episode 9), which brought much more nuance to her relationship with her brother, Billy
- The reveal that the "friendly orderly" was 001/Henry Creel/Vecna (episode 7), which was creepy, mind-blowing, and had an awesome fight between him and El
- Lucas defeating Jason and overcoming his desire to "fit in" with the "cool kids" (episode 9)
- Robin's feminist monologue which allowed her and Nancy to talk to Victor Creel (episode 4), which proves just how good Maya Hawke is at reading lines exceptionally quickly yet also organically
- Will clearly talking about himself and not El (episode 8), which made me simultaneously sad that Will was hurting, angry that Mike was oblivious, and annoyed that the Duffer brothers are still leaving room for ambiguity in Will's sexuality which [they promised they would resolve in Vol. 2](https://tvline.com/2022/06/02/stranger-things-is-will-gay-sexuality-season-4-duffer-brothers/)
- Eddie shredding Metallica's Master of Puppets while all hell breaks loose (episode 9), which [was just plain awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXnk3n-qNrI)
- Mike's "I love you" speech to El (episode 9), which felt earned despite it being cliche in nature
- El bringing down the helicopter and not forgiving Brenner for abusing and manipulating her (episode 8), which I appreciated because (1) it was badass and (2) redemption arcs should only be given to characters who are worthy
- The Sinclairs winning their respective games (episode 1)
- Eddie and Chrissy's talk outside school (episode 1), which was surprisingly charming and full of chemistry. Too bad they both died :(

Finally, I just wanted to shout out Jamie Campbell Bower for his incredible performance as Vecna, who is now my favorite Stranger Things villain: Creepy, personal, cruel, and apparently [thirst-inducing](https://twitter.com/Stranger_Things/status/1530958161036845057).

## The Meh

Splitting up the cast and spending too much time in CA/Nina/Russia. also too MANY cast members + death overhype by duffer
brothers. hopper should have stayed dead
will's sexuality exploration - still no explicit confirmation, but also you don't need to come out to be gay
    also while it makes for a very moving scene, having him romantically sabotage himself is *sigh*
    but.... noah's acting was great in that scene. obviously not talking about el there
    also sexuality confirmation overhype by duffer brothers
eddie's and max's "death" scenes
    max: 1) acting felt kinda flat, esp in comparison to tom holland's "i don't wanna go", 2) lack of eyes and physical movement (also a result of the writing. and maybe bc the writers intend for max to be blind next season?), 3) magical healing
        then again, the dilemma of killing off max

    eddie: the acting. feel like gaten works better as a comedic actor. also kinda obvious he'd die. also was it pointless?
clearly vecna is a retcon, but a well done one
jason and sullivan subplots - the INCOMPETENCY lmao. but I did like the rationality of jason in ep 9
will's bday retcon (lol)
writing is a bit corny in ep 8, also the power of friendship saves everyone in ep 4 and 9
nancy not aiming for the head *sigh*
angela and the bullies. while their level of bullying is consistent with troy from s1, it still felt very overdone
while finale was intense, the last half just felt like a s5 tease. pacing issues this season with 1, 4, 7, 9 being consequential and the rest feeling like they were jogging in place

## The Bad

2 days later time jump, barely any acknowledgement of eddie/max deaths or near-deaths or the fact that HAWKINS JUST SPLIT INTO 4, where tf are enzo, yuri, and dr. owens?
    also rushed reunions

magic healing powers
jonathan, will, and argyle did basically nothing
    please don't do will posession arc again, and please don't do will looks scared as he touches his neck arc again
    stoner jokes are funny I suppose but not enough to justify a character. argyle feels like he was just there for (a) comic relief, (b) a friend of the same age as jonathan, and (c) to get salt in ep 9
steve, nancy, jonathan love triangle
will's haircut. c'mon guys.

season ranking
1 (classic) > 3 (well paced, good balance of humor, heart, drama, horror) > 4 (ambitious, dark, back to horror roots, high stakes, but not great pacing) > 2 (pretty alright)

## Questions for S5

sooo how does vecna fit into the upside down lore?
how did the upside down become like hawkins if it originally was "untouched my man"?
will max wake up? will she be blind? paralyzed? completely fine? is her "soul" stolen bc vecna consumed her?
    max in a coma leaves exciting opportunities for s5
what was the significance of max's memory that el first went into (when she was at the skate park)?
how will the upside down leaking into the real world affect hawkins?
where are murray, enzo, yuri, dr owens?
if everything nancy saw came true, does that mean her entire family is going to die? that soldiers will come to hawkins?

## The Verdict

**8.5/10**

**Stranger Things 4 is an ambitious, dark, and intense 4th season that expands the lore and stakes, but is also weighed down by too many plotlines and characters.**

*Stranger Things 4 is out now on Netflix. It stars Winona Ryder (Joyce Byers), David Harbour (Jim Hopper), Millie Bobby Brown (Eleven / Jane Hopper), Finn Wolfhard (Mike Wheeler), Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin Henderson), Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas Sinclair), Noah Schnapp (Will Byers), Sadie Sink (Max Mayfield), Natalia Dyer (Nancy Wheeler), Charlie Heaton (Jonathan Byers), Joe Keery (Steve Harrington), Maya Hawke (Robin Buckley), Brett Gelman (Murray Bauman), Priah Ferguson (Erica Sinclair), Matthew Modine (Martin Brenner), Paul Reiser (Sam Owens), Jamie Campbell Bower (Henry Creel / One / Vecna), Cara Buono (Karen Wheeler), Eduardo Franco (Argyle), and Joseph Quinn (Eddie Munson).*
