As a self-proclaimed professional fangirl, I have the need to expand the fandoms I am in. As such, here is a list of 21 music, book, movie, and TV recommendations from the past few years of my life. These works of art are listed in no particular order.

## Music

> The TLDR from this section? I'm a big fan of songs that tell stories. (Film/TV scores are great too, but with only 5 picks I was limited.)

### Satisfied by Renee Elise Goldsberry, Original Broadway Cast of *Hamilton*

A whirlwind of emotions as you go from introductions to meet cute to yearning to a marriage to sisterly love. Plus, it's a delight to watch them "rewind" on stage.

### Eraser by Ed Sheeran

The burdens of fame, coping with vices, and coming out the other end. A great song for if you're tired but you need to keep going.

### She Used to Be Mine by Sara Bareilles

Funnily enough I first heard this song used in [So You Think You Can Dance](https://youtu.be/LY5TE0-kx40?feature=shared),
and little did I know one of the dancers would later have a successful music career (Tate McRae). At the time, I
also had no idea it was originally written for the musical *Waitress*.

Anyway, I love this song because you can interpret it in different ways: The speaker could be talking about an external "she" or an internal "she". Either way, it is a powerful ballad about regretting where you are at but finding the desire to pull yourself out of it.

### Split by 88rising, NIKI

For the immigrants who struggle to define home. While I am not an immigrant, the themes of having warring cultures in your head resonated with me.

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7AE1oyRpPGoSwDs8b9XBO0?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

### If We Have Each Other by Alec Benjamin

A heartwarming, wholesome, and catchy song about all the different kinds of love in our lives and how the relationships you build are all you really need.

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7pT6WSg4PCt4mr5ZFyUfsF?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

## Books

> A lot of my taste in books is stuck in my pre-college years, but that doesn't mean the books are bad!

### Six of Crows by Leigh Bardugo

<p style="text-align: center">

</p>

Six dangerous outcasts. One impossible heist. What more do you want???

In seriousness, I love this book because it was my gateway into the Grishaverse. It has impeccable world building, characterization, and plot. The characters are smart, sharp, and distinctive. They feel like real people even
though the things they accomplish together are incredible. And it's not your chosen one storyline - this is about
the criminals, outcasts, and rebels. If you want Ocean's Eleven but in a fantasy world, this book is for you.

### All My Rage by Sabaa Tahir

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1629908086i/57899793.jpg" alt="all my rage by sabaa tahir cover" height="250">
</p>

A beautiful, heartwrenching, and powerful coming of age story about being Pakistani-American in a small California desert town that spans 2 generations. This book doesn't pull punches, is excellently paced, and has well-written twists. The characters behave like real people who deal with real issues.

### Matilda by Roald Dahl

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388793265i/39988.jpg" alt="matilda by roald dahl cover" height="250">
</p>

A whimsical story about a book lover. (What can I say, as a book lover I am biased.)

### Kindred by Octavia E. Butler

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1339423248i/60931.jpg" alt="kindred by octavia e butler cover" height="250">
</p>

A historical sci-fi novel that interrogates how racism takes root.

### Becoming by Michelle Obama

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1528206996i/38746485.jpg" alt="becoming by michelle obama cover" height="250">
</p>

A look into the life of Michelle Obama.

Here's my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/127170934-rebecca) if you're curious. Looking at this reminds me I need to read more haha.

## Movies

> After years of franchise films from Marvel and Star Wars, I'm trying to diversify my taste. A24, indies, film festivals, and arthouse films here I come... but perhaps not yet. (In my defense, I went to Tribeca 2023.)

### *Everything Everywhere All At Once* (2022)

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XqZGLVVaL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg" alt="everything everywhere all at once poster" height="250">
</p>

The real multiverse movie that came out that year. Absurdly funny, philosophical, emotional, Asian-generational-trauma, LGBTQ+, action. It really does have everything everywhere all at once. I saw this 3 times in theaters.

### *Short Term 12* (2013)

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b8/Short_Term_12.jpg" alt="short term 12 poster" height="250">
</p>

Aside from seeing the beginnings of many Hollwood stars-to-be, this film deals with its subject matter -- learning to care for traumatized kids while dealing with your own trauma -- with a lot of heart.

### *Knives Out* (2019)

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1f/Knives_Out_poster.jpeg" alt="knives out poster" height="250">
</p>

A crowd-pleasing, laugh-out-loud, and twisty murder mystery with a side of social commentary about immigration politics in America.

### *Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse* (2023)

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b4/Spider-Man-_Across_the_Spider-Verse_poster.jpg" alt="spider-man: across the spider-verse poster" height="250">
</p>

Stunning animation in a multitude of styles, thrilling action, a budding ship, and the age old free will vs. determinism with a multiverse twist.

### *Inception* (2010)

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2e/Inception_%282010%29_theatrical_poster.jpg" alt="inception poster" height="250">
